Parenting as any experienced person will tell you, doesn't have a manual and isn't an easy task. As a team of developers we chose to create an easy-to-use application to share and discuss various tips, topics, and styles. This forum style site will be built completely from scratch and deployed through Heroku. This application will follow the MVC paradigm, use Sequilize as the ORM, and utilize packages such as, Express.js, Handlebars.js, and Axios.js.
